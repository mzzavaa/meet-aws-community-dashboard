In this engaging interview, we sit down with Chris Williams, an AWS Hero and community leader who currently serves as the Developer Relations Manager for HashiCorp in North America. Chris's journey into technology is as unique as his approach to building communities and solving complex technical challenges.

## An Unexpected Path into Tech

Chris's tech journey began unexpectedly during his college years while studying pre-med. What started as setting up a simple network for playing Doom with his roommates led to him being hired by his university to rebuild the entire Computer Science department's network infrastructure. This opportunity not only paid for his tuition but also launched his career in IT.

## From VMware to AWS: Evolution of a Tech Career

Before becoming deeply involved with AWS, Chris ran a VMware user group and hosted a technology podcast. Recognizing the transformative potential of cloud computing, he pivoted his focus to AWS and started the AWS Portsmouth user group. His community contributions eventually led to him becoming an AWS Hero after three nominations.

## Notable Projects and Achievements

One of Chris's most impactful early AWS projects involved helping a printing software company streamline their deployment process. Using CloudFormation, he reduced their implementation timeline from six months to just 29 minutes - a transformation that convinced him of cloud computing's game-changing potential.

## The Architect's Approach

As an enterprise architect, Chris developed a structured methodology for approaching projects, influenced by the TOGAF framework. He emphasizes four key areas when starting any project:

- Requirements
- Risks
- Assumptions
- Constraints

His signature approach involves getting stakeholders from all levels - from C-suite to engineers - in one room to hash out these elements before beginning any work.

## Community Impact and Education

Chris is passionate about education and helping others transition into tech careers. Through his podcast, The Brownbag, he's helped document paths from various non-technical roles into IT careers, including stories of waitresses becoming data analysts and truck drivers becoming network engineers.

## Advice for Cloud Beginners

For those starting their cloud journey, Chris emphasizes:

1. Turn on billing alarms first
2. Understand the "four food groups" of IT:
   - Networking
   - Storage
   - Compute
   - Security

He believes these fundamentals are essential before diving into more advanced cloud services.
