## Data Sources and Collection

This dashboard integrates data from AWS Community programs using a combination of scraping, API calls, and transformation scripts. The datasets are cleaned, enriched with geographic coordinates, and exported as CSV files for further use in dashboards or visualizations.

### 1. **AWS Community Builders**
- Data is collected using a script that queries an internal AWS website search endpoint (not an official public API).
- Two paginated queries are made to retrieve all entries:
  - First 2,000 records sorted A‚ÄìZ
  - Remaining records sorted Z‚ÄìA
- Extracted fields:
  - Name
  - Location (usually city or country)
  - Program category
  - Public bio/profile link
- **Latitude and longitude** are added using the `geopy` library with the **Nominatim geocoding service** to convert text-based locations into coordinates.
- The final cleaned and geocoded dataset is saved as `community_builders_complete.csv`.

### 2. **AWS User Groups (Meetup.com)**
- Event and group data is processed from a structured JSON response (typically exported from the Meetup GraphQL API).
- Extracted fields include:
  - Event title, date, location
  - Venue city and country
  - RSVP/‚Äúgoing‚Äù count
- **Member count** per user group is added manually or via pre-processed API data.
- Latitude and longitude may also be geocoded from venue city/country if not included.
- The result is saved as `meetup_similar_events.csv`.

### 3. **AWS Heroes**
- Data is either manually collected or scraped from the [AWS Heroes Directory](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/heroes/).
- Extracted fields:
  - Name, Hero category, location
  - Profile URL and image
- **Geolocation is applied** to convert the location field into latitude and longitude for mapping.
- Output is transformed and aligned with other data sources for integration.

---

### üßπ Data Cleaning and Enrichment
Across all sources:
- Entries with missing or malformed data are filtered out (e.g., empty names or locations).
- Locations are normalized before geocoding (e.g., trimming whitespace, consistent formatting).
- For duplicates or edge cases (e.g., multiple same names), basic disambiguation may be applied.
- Only structured fields relevant for display and mapping are retained.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** The data sources use internal search endpoints and external APIs. These may change without notice and are not officially supported by AWS or Meetup. This project and all associated data or outputs are intended solely for community or personal use and may not be used for commercial purposes.

   ```

2. Start the Hugo development server:
   ```
   hugo server -D
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:1313`

### Updating Data

The data files are located in the `static/data/` directory:

- `aws_heroes.csv`: AWS Heroes data

- `aws_user_groups_with_members.csv`: User Groups data with member counts

To update the data, simply edit these CSV files. The format should be maintained as follows:

#### AWS Heroes CSV Format
```
Name,Location,Category,Bio URL,Image URL,Latitude,Longitude,Status
```

#### Community Builders CSV Format
```
Name,Location,Category,Bio URL,Latitude,Longitude
```
